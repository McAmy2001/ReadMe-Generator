## Installation 
Step One: Clone this repo onto your local machine. Step Two: Install Node.js [Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs). Step Three: Navigate to the project's root on the command line, then install npm (Node Package Manager) ussing the command `npm install` (this will install the required dependencies listed in the package.json from the repo). 
## Usage 
On the command line type `node index`.This will prompt a series of questions. All questions require an answer. The more complete the information you enter the better the README will be. After the last question there will be a console.log of "Page Generated". The new README will be in the 'dist' folder of the repo.
